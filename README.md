# Rainy Road App

### An app to be ready for you trips


When i travel by motocycle in winter, it is common to not being raining where i started the trip, but raining on the city i was going to go or somewhere in the road.
So, i wouldn't be prepared for the rain waiting for me somewhere along my path.

I build this app for this, it will show if its raining on the road to your destination.

## Getting Started

It uses flutter on the app and it the map is generated on a server that you can set as well maybe in your localhost.

You can get the server side app [here](https://pages.github.com/).
